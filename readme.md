## How To Use The App

The user can search for media by typing in a search term into the search box and clicking the 'Search üîç' button to perform the search.
The user can filter the types of media to search for by typing the search term into the search box, selecting a media radio button/s and then clicking the 'Search üîç' button. Once the search results are displayed the user can then interact with them by clicking on any of the search results which will take the user to the website where more information can be seen, read and heard about that search result. The user can also click on the heart icon which will add that song to the user's list of favourites :heart:.
The user can remove an item from their list of favourites by clicking the 'X' button next to the item in the favourites list.
